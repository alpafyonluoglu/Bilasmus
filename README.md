Description:
Our team consists of 5 people: two frontend, two backend, and one full-stack developer. We are planning to use Node.js for the backend side, Vue.js for the frontend side, and MySQL as the database management system.
Bilasmus is a web based project to help both Bilkent University students, and faculty members during erasmus and exchange programs. Bilasmus is used after the approval of students. The program’s main goal is to minimize paperwork as much as possible, and ease the communication between students and faculty members. 
High Level Feature Design:
-Different users such as Erasmus/Exchange coordinators, outgoing students, ingoing students, bcc (as admin), international office will have access to the application.
-Erasmus students will upload the syllabus of all courses they wish to take during their exchange on Bilasmus.
-Bilasmus will check whether a student reaches min 30 ECTS max 40 ECTS.
-Accepted students will upload their pre-approval forms (in PDF format) to Bilasmus.
-If a student has a minor degree or double major degree, he/she should upload both for his/her major and minor/double major degree.
-Erasmus coordinators will be notified when a pre-approval form is uploaded.
-Coordinators will see a todo list of all student uploads.
-Courses will be merged by coordinators if the ECTS load is between 1-3 ECTS for one course, which is considered low based on Bilkent standards.
-Erasmus coordinators sign the documents electronically (for pre approval and course approval of all erasmus/exchange students).
-Students are responsible for uploading their language proficiency examination results on the website if their university requires such results.
-Outgoing students will upload their course approval forms (in PDF format) to Bilasmus.
-The students are responsible for updating the system in case there is any change to the syllabus of a course they are taking, even though the course may be pre approved by the system. 
-The outgoing students must upload their project reports upon returning if they took a project course. Coordinators will decide on whether or not to approve the course based on the complexity of the work done for the project course.
-If an outgoing student cancels their Erasmus/Exchange, the waiting list of other Erasmus/Exchange students will be re-evaluated and the coordinator is responsible for updating the list.
-There will be real-time pop-ups for notifications.
-Each user has a profile which consists of their email address, name surname, Bilkent ID.
-Users can click on the email address through coordinators’ or admin’s email address and send them an email.
-High-level users can email students by clicking on students’ email accounts on their profiles.
-Students will be able to click on a link that will redirect them to writing an email to the designated coordinator.
-All the previously accepted and rejected courses will be shown to the outgoing students.
-Erasmus coordinators will be notified when a new course approval is assigned at Bilasmus.
-Students will see the status of their application.
-All forms will be kept in pdf format.
-All departments will be able to use Bilasmus.
